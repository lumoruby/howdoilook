      <h1>The Magic of Color, Personal Color: Finding the Perfect Colors for You</h1>
      
      <p>Have you ever had the experience where the same colored clothes looked great on a friend but felt somehow awkward on you? The secret lies in 'personal color'. Personal color refers to a group of colors that harmonize with an individual's unique skin, hair, and eye color, adding vitality and positively shaping their image. Finding the right colors can make styling much easier and boost your confidence.</p>

      <h2>Why is Personal Color Important?</h2>
      <p>Colors that suit you can make your skin tone even and alleviate blemishes or dark circles, making you look vibrant and healthy overall. Conversely, colors that don't suit you can make your skin look dull, highlight flaws, and make your clothes feel detached from you. Knowing your personal color can help you reduce unnecessary spending when shopping and manage your wardrobe efficiently.</p>

      <h2>Personal Color Basics: Warm Tone vs. Cool Tone</h2>
      <p>Personal colors are broadly divided into 'Warm Tone' and 'Cool Tone'. This distinction is based on whether the color has a yellowish or bluish undertone.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warm Tone:</strong> Gives a warm and lively impression. Gold accessories generally suit well, and the veins on the wrist are close to green. Representative colors include ivory, coral, orange, and brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool Tone:</strong> Gives a cool and urban impression. Silver accessories suit well, and the veins on the wrist are close to blue or purple. Representative colors include pure white, lavender, magenta, and navy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Four Seasons Personal Color Types</h2>
      <p>Warm and cool tones are further subdivided into four seasonal types based on their lightness and saturation.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Spring Warm:</strong> Bright and warm colors with high saturation suit well. Creates a lovely and lively image. (e.g., coral pink, peach, light yellow)</li>
        <li><strong>Summer Cool:</strong> Bright and cool pastel tones with low saturation suit well. Creates an elegant and soft image. (e.g., lavender, sky blue, rose pink)</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn Warm:</strong> Deep and warm colors with low saturation are perfect. Creates a mature and intellectual image. (e.g., khaki, burgundy, mustard)</li>
        <li><strong>Winter Cool:</strong> Vivid, high-saturation cool colors or achromatic colors suit well. Creates a charismatic and chic image. (e.g., hot pink, cobalt blue, black, white)</li>
      </ol>
