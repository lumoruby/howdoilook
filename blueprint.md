# How Do I Look? - AI-Powered Style Analysis

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered web application designed to help users improve their personal style. Users can upload a photo, and the "AI" will provide feedback on their fashion, color choices, and overall look. The primary goal is to create a high-value, interactive website that meets and exceeds the quality standards for Google AdSense, ensuring successful monetization.

## Project Goals

1.  **Achieve Google AdSense Approval:** The main objective is to build a website with sufficiently high-quality, unique, and valuable content to be approved by Google AdSense.
2.  **Provide a Valuable User Tool:** Create an engaging and useful tool for users interested in fashion and style feedback.
3.  **Establish Authority:** Position the site as a credible resource for fashion and style advice through high-quality articles and content.
4.  **Modern & Accessible Design:** Ensure the website is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and accessible on all devices.

## Current Plan: Initial Build & Content Enhancement

This is the initial plan to transform the basic site into a feature-rich application that will pass AdSense review.

### Phase 1: Core Application and Content

1.  **[pending] Create `blueprint.md`:** Document the project vision, goals, and development plan.
2.  **[pending] Overhaul `index.html` (Main Application):**
    *   Create a dynamic user interface for the AI style analysis tool.
    *   Components:
        *   File upload button for user photos.
        *   An area to display the uploaded image.
        *   A "Analyze My Style" button.
        *   A section to display the AI-generated feedback.
    *   Implement the core logic in `main.js`. Initially, the "AI" will provide pre-defined, insightful feedback.
3.  **[pending] Enhance `style.css`:**
    *   Apply a modern, clean, and professional design.
    *   Use a consistent color palette, typography, and spacing.
    *   Ensure the entire site is mobile-responsive using modern CSS like Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
    *   Add hover effects and subtle animations for a polished feel.
4.  **[pending] Create High-Quality Content Pages:**
    *   **`about.html`:** Write a detailed "About Us" page explaining the mission of "How Do I Look?", how the AI works, and the team's passion for style.
    *   **`contact.html`:** Refine the existing `form.html` into a functional and professional contact page.
    *   **`privacy.html` & `terms.html`:** Generate comprehensive and legally-sound Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages, tailored for a service that handles user-uploaded images.
5.  **[pending] Create a Blog Section:**
    *   Create a new `blog.html` page to list articles.
    *   Write and add three high-quality, in-depth articles related to fashion and style:
        1.  "The Ultimate Guide to Finding Your Personal Style"
        2.  "Understanding Color Theory: How to Choose the Perfect Colors for You"
        3.  "10 Fashion Mistakes to Avoid in 2026"
    *   Each article will have its own HTML page (e.g., `blog-article-1.html`).
6.  **[pending] Implement Site-Wide Navigation:**
    *   Add a consistent header/navigation bar to all HTML pages linking to: Home, About, Blog, Contact, Privacy Policy, and Terms.
7.  **[pending] Final Review:**
    *   Thoroughly check for broken links, placeholder content, and any signs of an "under construction" site.
    *   Ensure every page provides genuine value to the user.
